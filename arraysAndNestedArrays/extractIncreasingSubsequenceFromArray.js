// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, you start from the first 
// element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, 
// alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to 
// the next number. The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence. Return the array of numbers.
